    question: "What is a web vulnerability scanner?",
    answer:
      "A web vulnerability scanner is a specialized software tool designed to automatically identify security flaws within web applications. A reliable, robust website security scanner should be able to mimic real attacker tactics and identify realistic, exploitable security issues.\n\nOur Website Vulnerability Scanner is a robust example of this type of tool, offering a comprehensive scan that identifies threats and also validates them to reduce false positives.\n\nIt works by interacting with the target application, sending a series of HTTP requests with specific payloads, and analyzing the responses to detect potential vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, OWASP Top10, and other pressing security issues and misconfigurations.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What types of web vulnerabilities can the Website Vulnerability Scanner detect?",
    answer:
      "The scanner can detect common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Security Misconfigurations, Broken Authentication, and other issues listed in the OWASP Top 10.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data safe while scanning?",
    answer:
      "Yes, our scanner does not store sensitive information from your application. It only tests for vulnerabilities and provides a report of potential security issues.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the scanning process safe for my website?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The scanner is designed for testing purposes only and does not exploit or damage the target system. It performs non-destructive security checks to identify vulnerabilities safely.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the system generate a vulnerability report?",
    answer:
      "Yes, after each scan, the system generates a detailed report highlighting detected vulnerabilities, their severity, and possible mitigation suggestions.",
  },
